# Smart Resume Analyzer & Job Matcher

## üîç Project Description
A cross-platform tool that:
- Analyzes resumes using NLP and machine learning
- Matches them to job descriptions
- Automates the process of ranking candidates or suggesting job roles
- Can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux (via Python CLI or web interface)

## üîß Core Features
1. **Resume Parsing & Analysis**
   - Use NLP to extract key information: skills, experience, education, certifications, etc.
   - Libraries: `spaCy`, `nltk`, `pdfminer.six`, `docx`, `PyMuPDF`

2. **Job Description Parsing**
   - Extract required skills, experience, and qualifications from job postings.
   - Normalize and categorize job roles and industries.

3. **Matching Algorithm**
   - Use machine learning or rule-based scoring to match resumes to job descriptions.
   - Consider cosine similarity, TF-IDF, or embedding models like BERT.

4. **Ranking System**
   - Score candidates based on relevance to job descriptions.
   - Provide explanations for rankings (e.g., missing skills, strong matches).

5. **Cross-Platform Interface**
   - **CLI**: Python-based CLI using `argparse` or `click`.
   - **Web Interface**: Flask or FastAPI backend with a React or simple HTML/CSS frontend.

6. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Suggest job roles based on resume content.
   - Visual analytics (e.g., skill match heatmaps).
   - Exportable reports (PDF/CSV).

## üß† Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: React.js or simple HTML/CSS/JS
- **NLP/ML**: spaCy, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker for cross-platform compatibility
